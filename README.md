use the conda environment "usbhere" for this project

Software summary / short description:
VirtualHere allows USB devices to be used remotely over a network just as if they were locally connected!

Traditionally USB devices needed to be plugged directly into your computer to be used. With VirtualHere this is no longer required, the network itself becomes the cable transmitting USB signals (also known as USB over IP, USB/IP, USB over WiFi, USB over Ethernet, USB Device Server).

This USB server solution is perfect for allowing USB devices to be used remotely over a LAN network, over the Internet, or in the Cloud without the USB device needing to be physically attached to remote client machine. The USB device appears as if it was directly attached even though it is plugged in to a remote server, therefore all existing drivers and software work, no special changes required.

The software will automatically find USB devices shared by VirtualHere USB Servers on the network. Available USB devices will be displayed in a tree. Right click on the device you want to use and select Use. It will then appear to be directly connected to your machine and can be used just like a local device!
